      <p>happy anniversary, baby!! today is a reminder for us, of everything we’ve been through, and of how far we’ve come together.</p>

      <p>we’ve had our ups and downs, and i won’t deny that. may mga araw na masaya, may mga araw na mahirap, at may mga araw na parang gusto na lang sumuko. pero kahit ganun, nandito pa rin tayo.</p>

      <p>i know i’ve made mistakes along the way. i hurt you, disappointed you, and gave you reasons to overthink. i don't deny it, and i will always take responsibility for those moments.</p>

      <p>but this anniversary is important to me because it reminds me that growth is real. i’m not the same person i was before. i’m learning, i’m changing, and i’m choosing to be better not just for you, but for us.</p>

      <p>every day, i try to improve myself. not because i’m forced, but because i want to. gusto kong maging taong deserving sa pagmamahal mo at sa tiwalang binibigay mo sa akin.</p>

      <p>i know healing takes time. alam kong hindi agad mawawala yung sakit at takot. and i want you to know that i respect that. i’m willing to wait, to prove, and to reassure you as many times as you need.</p>

      <p>our relationship taught me patience, understanding, and accountability. tinuruan mo akong makinig, mag understand, and mas maging conscious sa actions ko.</p>

      <p>there were moments when we misunderstood each other, when emotions were too heavy, and words were said out of pain. pero kahit ganun, we still found our way back.</p>

      <p>what matters to me most is that despite everything, we didn’t give up easily. we chose to stay, to talk, and to fix things even when it was uncomfortable.</p>

      <p>i appreciate you so much, more than i can ever fully express. salamat sa patience mo, sa love mo, at sa paniniwala mo sa akin kahit may mga araw na mahirap.</p>

      <p>you inspire me to be better. hindi dahil kailangan, but dahil gusto ko. you make me want to grow, mature, and love more deeply.</p>

      <p>this anniversary isn’t about perfection. it’s about progress. it’s about us two who are still learning, still healing, and still choosing each other.</p>

      <p>i promise to keep improving myself. i promise to communicate better, to be more honest, and to always consider your feelings.</p>

      <p>hindi ko man mabura yung past, pero kaya kong patunayan araw-araw na iba na ang present at mas maayos ang future na gusto kong buuin kasama ka.</p>

      <p>i want a future where we look back at this phase and say “kinaya natin”. a future where this pain turned into strength and understanding.</p>

      <p>thank you for staying, for loving me, and for not giving up on us. hindi ko tine-take for granted kahit isang bagay tungkol sayo.</p>

      <p>tonight, i just want you to feel loved, valued, and secure. gusto kong maramdaman mo na seryoso ako sayo and sa relationship natin.</p>

      <p>happy anniversary, baby. this is just the beginning of a better version of usand i’m choosing you today, tomorrow, and every day.</p>
